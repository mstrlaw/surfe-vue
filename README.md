## UI/UX Implementation Details

1. The UI follows a mobile-first approach, reflected by how the breakpoint mixins are applied;
2. CSS class naming follows BEMIT convention;
3. CSS attributes are ordered alphabetically;
4. We make use of SCSS preprocessor mainly for Mixins and Nesting; Native CSS custom properties are prefered over SCSS variables;
